# Zach's Rails Templates

Just a collection of templates for generating rails apps.

To use one just utilize the -m option and point your new generator at the template script.

It's kind of annoying to work around SSL with the file hosted on github, so while the -m option does take 
a URL, I've found it's much simpler to just download the script you want and point to it locally.

For exmaple:


```console
rails new my_app -m C:/Users/Zachary/Documents/user_rails_template.rb
```
